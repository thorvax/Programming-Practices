                    The map method is a powerful tool in JavaScript that allows you to transform an array by applying a function to each element. It creates a new array with the results of calling the provided function on every element in the original array. This method is particularly useful for data manipulation and transformation tasks.
                    <br><br>
                    The syntax for the map method is as follows:
                    <code>array.map(callback(currentValue[, index[, array]])[, thisArg])</code>
                    <br><br>
                    Here, <code>callback</code> is a function that is called for each element in the array. It takes three arguments: <code>currentValue</code> (the current element being processed), <code>index</code> (the index of the current element), and <code>array</code> (the original array). The <code>thisArg</code> parameter is optional and can be used to set the value of <code>this</code> inside the callback function.
                    <br><br>
                    The map method returns a new array containing the results of applying the callback function to each element of the original array. It does not modify the original array.
                    <br><br>
                    Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate how the map method works:
                    <pre>
                        const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
                        const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
                        console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
                    </pre>
                    In this example, we have an array of numbers, and we use the map method to
                    create a new array called <code>doubled</code> that contains each number multiplied by 2. The original array <code>numbers</code> remains unchanged.
                    <br><br>
